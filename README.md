This is a repository for my experiments with embedded software develepoment, microcontrollers, RTOS, etc

Some experiments:
- Create a build system that handles dependencies to make the building efficient.
- Enable different hw capabilities in the microcontroller, like hw watchdog, output clock signal, enable interrupts, etc
- Enable use of RTOS (FreeRTOS) in the project.
- Create basic application use cases that involve tasks, interrupts, queues, etc
- Use docker environment for compilation, flashing, debugging, etc. No need to have toolchain installed in local system. Building image can be easily distributed.
